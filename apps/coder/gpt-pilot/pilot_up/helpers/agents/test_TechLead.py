The project entails creating a web-based chat application, tentatively named "chat_app." 
This application does not require user authentication or chat history storage. 
It solely supports one-on-one messaging, excluding group chats or multimedia sharing like photos, videos, or files. 
Additionally, there are no specific requirements for real-time functionality, like live typing indicators or read receipts. 
The development of this application will strictly follow a monolithic structure, avoiding the use of microservices, as per the client's demand. 
The development process will include the creation of user stories and tasks, based on detailed discussions with the client.
