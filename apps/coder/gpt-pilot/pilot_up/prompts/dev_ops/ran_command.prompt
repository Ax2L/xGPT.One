{{ additional_info }}I ran the command `{{ command }}`
{%- if exit_code is number %}, the exit code was {{ exit_code }}{% endif %}
{%- if error_response %}, it {{ error_response }}{% endif %}. The output was:

{{ cli_response }}

If the command was successfully executed, respond with `DONE`. If it wasn't, respond with `NEEDS_DEBUGGING`.
