So far, steps {{ finished_steps }} are finished so let's do
{% else %}
Let's start with the{% endif %} step #{{ step_index }}:
```
{{ step_description }}
```
This step by step about what needs to be done to fulfill this step. 
{% if step_type == 'COMMAND' %}
Respond with all commands that need to be run to fulfill this step. In case this is a complex step that can't be completed by only running commands (maybe it requires some code changes or user review), respond with an array with only one item `COMPLEX`. Like this - `[{"command": "COMPLEX", "timeout": 0}]`
{% elif step_type == 'CODE_CHANGE' %}
First, you need to know the code that's currently written so that you can appropriately write new or update the existing code. {# Here are all the file that are written so far in a file tree format:
```
{{ directory_tree }}
```
#}
Respond with a list of files that you need to see before you can write the code for the current step. This list needs to be in a JSON array where each item is a file name. Do not respond with anything other than the mentioned JSON array.
