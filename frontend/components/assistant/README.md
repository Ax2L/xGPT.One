# Notes
- Customize the username and SVG avatar in the [custom.py](https://github.com/PierXuY/ChatGPT-Assistant/blob/main/custom.py) file.
- Edit the [set_context.py](https://github.com/PierXuY/ChatGPT-Assistant/blob/main/set_context.py) to add predefined context options, which will automatically synchronize with the application.
- Consider modifying the file read/write logic in [helper.py](https://github.com/PierXuY/ChatGPT-Assistant/blob/main/helper.py) to use a cloud database, to prevent loss of chat history.
