Now please translate the Chinese symbols to English in the following file and provide me the translated version copy-and-paste ready and:
- Add comments and overall a better documentation in the file for better understanding of function and step.
- Furthermore, integrate the 'Colored Regions' guidelines for Visual Studio Code in the code you offer.  
- This includes:
  - Using Colored Regions with appropriate rgba values, e.g., `#// region [ rgba(0, 100, 250, 0.05)] Initialization`.
  - Maintaining consistent naming and color schemes for regions. If one section of code is labeled `Initialization`, the same label should be used for similar sections across multiple files with the same color.
    
  - Including a matching `#// endregion` tag for every `#// region` tag used.

Dont forget that some code is incomplete because of the segment i created to split the size. The missing part will come with a overhead, you should be able to find matching points for easier fix

WE ARE WORKING ON A VERY IMPORTANT PROJECT! PLEASE DO NEVER AGAIN CUT SOMETHING OUT IN YOUR RESPONSES!
