"""This is example shows how to **upload multiple files** via the
[File Uploader Widget](https://streamlit.io/docs/api.html?highlight=file%20upload#streamlit.file_uploader)

As far as I can see you can only upload one file at a time. So if you need multiple files in your
app, you need to store them in a static List or Dictionary. Alternatively they should be uploaded
as one .zip file.

Please note that file uploader is a **bit problematic** because
- You can only upload one file at the time.
- You get no additional information on the file like name, size, upload time, type etc. So you
cannot distinguish the files without reading the content.
- every time you interact with any widget, the script is rerun and you risk processing or storing
the file again!
- The file uploader widget is not cleared when you clear the cache and there is no way to clear the
file uploader widget programmatically.

Based on the above list I created [Issue 897](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/897)

This example was based on
[Discuss 1445](https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/uploading-multiple-files-with-file-uploader/1445)
