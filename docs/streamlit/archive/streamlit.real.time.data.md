# Real-Time Data Dashboard with Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that's useful for creating custom web apps for data science and machine learning. It offers a simple way to visualize real-time or dynamic data. Below is a guide on how you can set up a real-time data science dashboard using Streamlit.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
```

---

### Data Retrieval
We'll be fetching data from a GitHub repository as an example. We'll use Streamlit's `@st.experimental_memo` to cache data, reducing the load time on subsequent runs.

```python
import pandas as pd
import streamlit as st

@st.experimental_memo
def get_data():
    dataset_url = "https://your-dataset-url.com"
    return pd.read_csv(dataset_url)
```

---

### Setting Up the Dashboard
Initialize your Streamlit dashboard with a title and any filters or controls you want to add.

```python
st.title("Real-Time Data Science Dashboard")
job_filter = st.selectbox("Select the Job", ['Engineer', 'Doctor', 'Teacher'])
```

---

### Real-Time Data Simulation
To simulate real-time data, you can loop through your data, applying some random manipulations for demonstration purposes.

```python
import numpy as np
import time

df = get_data()
df = df[df["job"] == job_filter]

for i in range(100):
    df['new_column'] = df['existing_column'] * np.random.choice(range(1, 5))
    # your code here to display data or charts
    time.sleep(1)
```

---

### Displaying KPI Metrics
Streamlit allows for the easy display of KPI metrics. Below is an example that calculates and displays the average age and account balance.

```python
avg_age = np.mean(df['age'])
balance = np.mean(df['balance'])

st.metric(label='Average Age', value=avg_age)
st.metric(label='Average Account Balance', value=balance)
```

---

### Plotting
You can also display real-time charts using Plotly or any other plotting library supported by Streamlit.

```python
import plotly.express as px

fig = px.density_heatmap(data_frame=df, y="age", x="job")
st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

---

## Conclusion
This is just a basic example to get you started on creating real-time data dashboards with Streamlit. You can expand on this by including more complex data manipulations, charts, or even integrating real-time data streams.

Remember to run your Streamlit app with `streamlit run your_script.py` in your terminal to see it in action!
