GOAL: TUI to handle the setup, installing dependecies, executing, docker,  docker-compose, collecting health aand other systemdata to display it on the page that they brought with them.
I already checked for the perfect framework and code language fpr, and we diceded for "pTerm" where ou need first the documenattation before you can start building something right?


Must have/be:
- The Framework of our choise is
- Minimalistic, so easy to find what you needed.
- Base Colors, that we use anywhere.
- Progressbar that really works! therefore i want to have:
- Colored segments for vscode, tuse 

Please follow the Styleguide as well when providing the updated code:
A sh



Yes we should focus on: - The Framework of our choise is, - Minimalistic, so easy to find what you needed. - Base Colors, that we use anywhere. - Progressbar that really works! therefore i want to have: - Colored segments for vscode, tuse 

I want to track the CPU with each Kernel, the Memory, Harddrive then i need also some docker container and maybe some of the system processes.


I want to have realtime only for the System health, the others should be updated when the User lands on the certain page where it belongs to.
