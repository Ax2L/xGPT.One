**Instructions for Generating Component Styles from TOML Input:**

1. **TOML Input Examination**: Start by carefully reviewing the TOML file. It provides the core values you will be integrating into the CSS-similar format.

2. **Component Creation**:
   - **Core Component Rule**: You must use the TOML content to dynamically populate the properties of components in the Python dictionary format.
   - **Data Extraction Method**: Access the TOML content as `toml_data["<section_name>--<property_name>"]`. E.g., `toml_data["headers--backgroundColor"]`.

3. **Component Design Principles**:
   - **Relevance**: Not every TOML value needs to be applied to every component. Apply styles that logically fit the component's purpose. For instance, don't use a `background-color` meant for headers on a button unless it's contextually relevant.
   - **Comprehensiveness**: Ensure each component is styled in a comprehensive manner. If a component can have a hover, active, and click state, ensure styles exist for each state. Use the provided TOML values for these, like `primary_hover`, `primary_active`, and so forth.

4. **Combining Styles**:
   - **Critical Thinking**: It's essential to logically combine multiple styles for a component if they enhance the user experience and aesthetics. For example, an `iconbutton` might need a combination of `background-color`, `filter`, `text-align`, and any other relevant styles.
   - **Avoid Redundancies**: If two components are likely to share the exact same styles, consider how best to optimize this. You may need a base style that other components can inherit.

5. **Final Output Structure**:
   - Your end result must closely resemble the provided structure, namely the `HEADERS` dictionary example. Populate it dynamically using the TOML content.
   - Each key in the dictionary represents a component (e.g., `stHeader`, `flex`, `header`, etc.). Each of these keys will have its own dictionary of styles.
   - Maintain the order and naming conventions. No deviations.

6. **Validation**: 
   - Once you've populated the styles, cross-check with the TOML file. Ensure all relevant data points have been utilized and applied to the components logically.

*Final Note*: The essence of this task is to ensure the components are styled in a manner that's not just consistent with the TOML data, but also visually and functionally coherent. You must employ a mix of strict adherence to the instructions and your own informed judgment.
