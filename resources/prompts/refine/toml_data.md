# Refining TOML Content for ChatGPT:
---
```markdown

**Input TOML Data:**
``toml
{{input}}
``

**Instructions for ChatGPT:**
1. **Reorder** the TOML content for clarity and organization.
2. **Adjust naming conventions** to ensure consistency across all entries.
3. **Identify and add** any missing entries that are relevant and necessary for the configuration.
4. For each color entry, add **color variants** for different states (e.g., hover, active, click). If a base color like "#FFFFFF" is provided, generate its corresponding variations.
5. If you're uncertain about any entry, **make a logical decision** based on the existing data.
6. **Provide a summary** of the work done, followed by the full, refined TOML data.

**Expected Output:**
A brief summary followed by a refined TOML configuration that's "COPY & PASTE READY".
