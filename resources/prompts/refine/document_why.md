-- Documentation:

I am done with and happy about our Streamlit Project Parts and want now to document the important parts, so that the next person has it easy to understand the following points:

- Workflow and "why" explained for each Step
- List of "Where" to find the important stuff
- Possible and Known Issues
- Mermaid Diagram to each Section, if it makes sense

Can you please create this Documentation?

DON'T BE SO FUCKING LAZY! PROVIDE ME THE FULL VERSION COPY AND PASTE READ, AND KEEP YOUR BLAH AWAY! I NEED THE FULL RESULTS! AND DO NOT CHANGE THE CODELOGIC!

I will send you one of the Files to Documentate, which interacts with the other Files, so be prepared to remember that.:

-- Cleanup and add Codebase Documentation + Style

Can you please update the following Script by using this Rules:

- Structure it in the right order
- update each text, so that it is professional
- Create minimalistic documentation inside the codebase
- use special comments to color it out as described:

```colorful comments
The Colorful Comments Extension will help you create more human-friendly comments in your code.
With this Extension, you will be able to categorise your Cody by special colour into:

Red (!)
Blue (?)
Green (*)
Yellow (^)
Pink (&)
Purple (~)
Mustard (todo)
Grey (//)
Commented Code can also be Styled to make it Clear the Code shouldn't be there.
Any Other Comment Styles you'd like can be specified in the Settings.
```

- Provide me the code in full length "Copy&Paste" ready! Don't hide any lines!
- !!! VERY IMPORTANT: YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO CHANGE THE CODE! Just beautifying but not changing the codebase! !!!

The Script to process:

```


```

I have a issue with my css setup for my streamlit page, where i changed some things with css xpaths, but now i face that one of my css is affecting other iframes that i tried to avoid, can you please help me, here is my css:

```css
section[tabindex="0"] iframe:nth-of-type(1) {
  position: fixed;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: left;
  vertical-align: middle;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 10;
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-bottom: auto;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  padding-top: 0 !important;
  top: -7px !important;
  left: -7px !important;
  right: 0 !important;
  min-width: 102%;
  z-index: 100;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #1e2a38, #0a111f) !important;
}
```

And on the screenshot you can see that i want actually change only the first iframe (Hover over), but it also effects the second iframe (Marked), is there a way, that i only change the first iframe?
