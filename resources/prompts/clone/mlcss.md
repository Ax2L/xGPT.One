Please check and take your time to think about the advanced CSS code behind the design, style, and color of the object that we can see on the screenshot.
- Then create an HTML and CSS code, which I can copy and paste into codepen.io, to check your creation and send it back to you as a screenshot, so that you can improve your version often, till I tell you that it's good.
- Keep your responses focused on providing the code and necessary stuff only! No blah blah!
- I will keep this message in every response, to constantly remind you, to not do shit!!
